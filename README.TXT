This is a little program I wrote to help understand z-ordering. 

What it does is display a bug on the desktop.   The bug periodically 
moves behind the window that is the topmost window on the desktop.  
If you move the window that it is under, it will either scurry after 
the window that was moved or run off to hide behind another window.
  

This code was built for 6.167F.  It will not run under 1.3 or 6.149.  
The code is included so that one could recompile it for either of 
those two environments.  It has some quirks, but those just give the 
bug a personality. <grin>
